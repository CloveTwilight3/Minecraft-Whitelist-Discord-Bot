  # The old ! commands have been replaced with modern Discord slash commands:
  # /whitelist <player> - Add a player to the whitelist
  # /unwhitelist <player> - Remove a player from the whitelist
  # /listwhitelist - Display all whitelisted players
  # /whois <@user> - Find Minecraft accounts linked to a Discord user
  # /whomc <username> - Find Discord user linked to a Minecraft username
